# TripleTen AB test project

## Project description
### Context
For this project, I assumed the role of an analyst at a large online store. I have worked alongside the marketing department to compile a list of hypotheses aimed at boosting revenue. Now, my task is to prioritize these hypotheses, conduct an A/B test, and analyze the resulting data.

### Description of the data
#### Data used in the first part of the project
hypotheses_us.csv
 - Hypotheses — brief descriptions of the hypotheses
 - Reach — user reach, on a scale of one to ten
 - Impact — impact on users, on a scale of one to ten
 - Confidence — confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten
 - Effort — the resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.

#### Data used in the second part of the project
orders_us.csv
 - transactionId — order identifier
 - visitorId — identifier of the user who placed the order
 - date — of the order
 - revenue — from the order
 - group — the A/B test group that the user belongs to
 - date — date
 - group — A/B test group
 - visits — the number of visits on the date specified in the A/B test group specified
